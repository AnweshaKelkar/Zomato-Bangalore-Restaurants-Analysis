# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews in Zomato Bangalore Restaurants
Reviews on Zomato are still in the form of text and can be classified with positive, negative, or neutral ratings. Zomato doesnâ€™t have an analysis of how users interact with the reviews and which words indicate that the customers enjoyed their restaurant experience or not. We need to extract the words from the reviews and analyse them so we know how users interact in the Zomato review section.<br /><br />
